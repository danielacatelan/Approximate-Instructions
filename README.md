This repository demonstrates how to integrate approximate instructions into the RISC-V instruction set and SPIKE simulator.

The approximate instruction project includes both integer (addx, subx, mulx, divx) and floating-point (faddx, fsubx, fmulx, fdivx) operations, which are part of my doctoral thesis on "Design Space Exploration with Approximate Computing."

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for developing and implementing approximate instructions for both integer and floating-point operations in RISC-V architecture and SPIKE simulator.

## Prerequisites

The following guide should be followed in order to download, setup and use all the tools: [INSTALLING.md](./docs/INSTALLING.md)

### Part 1: Adding Approximate Instructions to RISC-V Toolchain

Follow carefully the [RISC-V GNU Toolchain setup guide](./docs/APPROX_SETUP_PART_1.md). Then go the next part.

### Part 2: Adding Approximate Instructions to SPIKE

Follow carefully the [Spike setup guide](./docs/APPROX_SETUP_PART_2.md).
